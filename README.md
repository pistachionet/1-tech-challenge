# Go Tech Challenge: Blog API

## Overview

This challenge is designed to allow the developer to become familiar with the concepts of writing a REST API in Golang.

The challenge consists of three parts. In part 1, developers will handle the technical setup required to complete the challenge. For part 2, developers can follow a simple walkthrough designed to teach them the basics of the Gin framework and Go concepts they will be using for the rest of the challenge. For experienced developers, you can choose to skip this part. Finally, part three will cover the requirements to complete the challenge, along with the rubric that will be used for grading.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic idioms of Go: project structure, syntax, testing, etc.
- Develop a familiarity with setting up and maintaining Go development environments
- Gain the ability to work with common Go packages

## Grading Criteria

Your code will be graded on the following:
- How well the code completes the objective outlined in the assignment
- How well your code follows the idioms of Go
- How well your unit tests actually test the code
- How clean your code is


## Prerequisites

- A working knowledge of Go. You can achieve this by completing [The Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)

## Additional Documents

If you are new to Go, you might be surprised by some concepts or syntaxes that differ from other languages. If you get stuck while working through this tech challenge, here are some resources that might clear up those key distinctions:

## Next Steps

After reading over the overview, proceed to part 1: [Technical Setup](docs/1-Technical-Setup.md). This will cover all the installations and setup necessary for the challenge.
